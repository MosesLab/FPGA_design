=================================================================

INTRODUCTION
============

Thank you for choosing the Virtex-5 Embedded MAC from Xilinx!
The Xilinx Virtex-5 Embedded MAC is a fully verified, pre-
implemented core.

Please refer to the Getting Started Guide for more information 
on how to set up and use the Virtex-5 Embedded MAC wrapper and
example design.

This document contains the release notes for Virtex-5 Embedded 
MAC wrapper Version 1.3 which includes enhancements, resolved 
issues and outstanding known issues.


RELEASE NOTES
=============

This section lists the enhancements and known issues associated with this
release.

1. Enhancements

   * Support added for ISE 9.2i
   * Consolidated the user constraints into a single UCF file to simplify 
     the NGCBUILD processing
   * Reworked the GMII and RGMII input delays to improve jitter 
     performance. Fixed mode IODELAYs are now instantiated on both the 
     data and clock inputs. Users should specify the values of the 
     delays in the UCF file.

2. Known Issues

   For a list of the current known issues with the Virtex-5
   Embedded MAC Wrapper v1.2, please refer to Answer Record 25222:

*  CR227610: TEMAC DCRBASEADDR inconsistent between VHDL and Verilog.

VHDL DCR bus simulations will fail in Modelsim PE. This is a problem with
Modelsim PE only. Modelsim SE and IUS simulations work correctly.
The bug results in the bits of the EMAC#_DCRBASEADDR generic in the VHDL 
Unisim and Simprim models being flipped. Both functional and timing 
simulations are affected.
A workaround is to set EMAC#_DCRBASEADDR to a symmetric value, 
e.g. 0x81 or 0xC3.
