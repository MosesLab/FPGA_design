Comments On Flashing the FPGA

In Design NotesJAH.docx, the hardware setup for flashing the FPGA is explained.  

After the hardware has been setup, instructions for programming the device can be found in the CTI-FreeForm-PCI104.pdf document, starting on page 22. 

Paying attention to the note on page 22, notice that the design work can be done in ISE 14.x, but the FPGA should be programmed using ISE 13.4 Lab tools.
The lab tools are different from the full ISE 13.4 package in that flashing the software using the lab tools does not require a compile of the source code.
Make sure the 13.4 lab tools are installed instead of the full ISE 13.4.

When starting iMPACT(step 2), load the file \MOSES\moses_release_rev3\moses_fpga_design\moses_fpga design_impact.
this project references the following files:

MOSES\moses_release_rev3\moses_fpga_design\moses_fpga_design.bit
MOSES\moses_release_rev3\MCS_File\Moses\MOSES_Release_Rev3.mcs
MOSES\referencedesigns\fpga\bsdl\PCI9056BA.bsd
MOSES\referencedesigns\fpga\bsdl\DP8349IVS.bsd

Jumper J1 should be configured in its third setting, since we want to program directly to flash.
